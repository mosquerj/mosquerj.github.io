    <h1>All About Hippos</h1>

    <!-- Two Paragraphs -->
    <p>Hippopotamuses, often referred to as hippos, are large, mostly herbivorous mammals found in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their bulky appearance, hippos are surprisingly fast and agile in water. They spend much of their time in rivers and lakes, keeping their bodies cool under the hot African sun. Hippos are considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa due to their aggressive nature and territorial behavior.</p>
    <p>A full-grown hippo can weigh between 1,500 and 4,000 pounds, making it one of the heaviest land animals on Earth. Their diet primarily consists of grass, and they can consume up to 80 pounds of vegetation in a single night. Hippos are social creatures that live in groups called pods, which typically consist of 10 to 30 individuals. These fascinating animals play a vital role in their ecosystem, helping to maintain the health of aquatic environments.</p>
